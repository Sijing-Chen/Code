SSA with delay.py is used to simulate the temporal evolution of cell trajectories.
Euler with delay.py is used to develop the deterministic equation trajectories and production rates.
globalpoints.py is used to simulate the global sampled cells and record the final positions.
globalpoints_to_show.ipynb is used to show the final positions recorded from globalpoints.py
